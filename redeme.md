1. traversing
2. inserting
3. delete and insert or delete
4. linear search 
5. mearge two array (marge using for loop as and inbuld method spread operator ... , reverse an array and , sort an array )
6. mearge Array using while loop and sort them .
(space and time complexity) ==> 
space complexity => memory consumption
time complexity ==> google it 
video 8. time and space complexity 
..Alorithim  = steps to taken for doing any work (like you want to go somewhere for that you take steps link by car se jana hai , bike se jana hai ,there are many ways to go that is algo , time complexity algorithi pr depend hote hai time and algo pr hi depend hote hai)
video 9 . Asymptoyic Analisis and notaion
video 10 = array sorting = (based on nested looping)(we are going to use bubble sort here)
video 11 = > resecursion () (11 ,12,13 ,14) rescursion
video 15 = stack
